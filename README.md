# Learning How to Learn

> If you understand just a little bit of some of the basics about how your brain works, you can learn more easily and be less frustrated.

## 2 Modes of Thinking

1. Focused
    * Intense Concentration
2. Diffused
    * Relaxed Thinking

* We are either in the focused xor diffused mode of thinking.  When we learning something new, our mind needs to be able to go back and forth between the focused and diffused modes of thinking to learn effectively
* Our mind is like a muscle, a little work everyday gradually builds neural structure
* Metaphors provide powerful techniques for learning
* Learning something difficult takes time

## What is Learning
* [brainfacts.org](brainfactos.org)
* Our brain weight 3 pounds, but consumes 10x more energy by weight than the rest of the body
* Our brain is the most complex device in the known universe
* All our thoughts, hopes, and fears are neurons in our brain
* Seeing, hearing, reaching, running: are complex problems beyond the capability of the world's fastest super computers
  * This illustrates that we are *not* consciously aware of how our brains work
  * Brains evolved to help us navigate complex environments (most of the heavy lifting is done below our level of consciousness)
* Brain connectivity is dynamic even after the brain is mature
  * Constant turnover, with new synapses being formed and others disappearing
  * Learning changes the structure of the brain

## Procrastination

### Problem
1. Unhappy feeling
2. Funnel attention to a more pleasant task
3. Feel happy (temporarily)

* We all have some issues with procrastination because if we're working on one thing, it means we're *not* working on a lot of other things
* When considering an unpreferable task, we activate the areas of the brain associated with pain
  * Naturally, our problem-solving brains look for a way to stop that negative stimulation by switching our attention to something more pleasant
    * Temporarily we feel happier
  * Neurodiscomfort disappears shortly after the brain actually starts working out what it didn't like

### Solution
* [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique)
  * 25 minutes (then take break & reward brain with mental relaxation)
  * no interruptions
  * focus

## Practice Makes Permanent
* When you first begin to understand something, the neural pattern is there, but very weak.  Practicing how to solve a problem strengthens and deepens the neural pattern as a firm foundation of understanding.
* Learning is like building a wall from bricks and mortar
  * A little bit each day allows the mortar time to dry and makes a solid foundation to continually build upon
  * All at once cramming does *not* allow the mortar to set, and the wall falls, since it cannot sustain itself

## Chunking

* Grasp and master key ideas

1. What is a Chunk
2. Why We Can and Should Enhance Our Chunking Skills

## Memory

2 types of memory are related:

1. Working Memory
  * the part of memory used immediately and consciously via the prefrontal cortex
  * has 4 slots for information, thus we often repeat information to retain it in working memory
    * example: repeating a phone number until we can write it down
    * shutting eyes to avoid distractions from intruding into the limited working memory slots
    * each slot can be used for a chunk of information, so it seems our working memory is bigger than it actually is
2. Long-term Memory
  * like a storage warehouse, data is distributed over a large area
  * storing data in long-term memory requires repetition to increase the likelihood of being able to retrieve that data upon demand in the future
  * immense storage capacity with room for billions of items
  * storage for fundamental concepts and techniques involved in whatever we are learning about
  * **spaced repetition** can be used to transfer data into long-term memory
    * repeating what we're trying to retain over several days
    * take breaks between sessions to allow the "mortar to dry" when building the structure of understanding upon a firm foundation
      * time allows for synaptic connections to form and strengthen

## The Importance of Sleep in Learning
* Being awake creates toxic products in our brains
* The brain keeps itself clean and healthy
  * During sleep, the brain cells shrink to create space between brain cells like unblocking a stream to flow past these cells and wash the toxins out
  * Tidy up ideas/concepts we are thinking/learning about
  * Erase less important memories and strengthen important memories
* Insufficient sleep can be associated with headaches, depression, heart disease, diabetes and early death
* Allows the brain to continually rehearse difficult material we are trying to learn
* Dreaming about what we're trying to learn is beneficial to learning it

# 10 Rules of Good Studying
* A Mind for Numbers: How to Excel in Math and Science (Even if You Flunked Algebra), by Barbara Oakley, Penguin, July, 2014
1. **Use recall.** After you read a page, look away and recall the main ideas. Highlight very little, and never highlight anything you haven’t put in your mind first by recalling. Try recalling main ideas when you are walking to class or in a different room from where you originally learned it. An ability to recall—to generate the ideas from inside yourself—is one of the key indicators of good learning.
2. **Test yourself.** On everything. All the time. Flash cards are your friend.
3. **Chunk your problems.** Chunking is understanding and practicing with a problem solution so that it can all come to mind in a flash. After you solve a problem, rehearse it. Make sure you can solve it cold—every step. Pretend it’s a song and learn to play it over and over again in your mind, so the information combines into one smooth chunk you can pull up whenever you want.
4. **Space your repetition.** Spread out your learning in any subject a little every day, just like an athlete. Your brain is like a muscle—it can handle only a limited amount of exercise on one subject at a time.
5. **Alternate different problem-solving techniques during your practice.** Never practice too long at any one session using only one problem-solving technique—after a while, you are just mimicking what you did on the previous problem. Mix it up and work on different types of problems. This teaches you both how and when to use a technique. (Books generally are not set up this way, so you’ll need to do this on your own.) After every assignment and test, go over your errors, make sure you understand why you made them, and then rework your solutions. To study most effectively, handwrite (don’t type) a problem on one side of a flash card and the solution on the other. (Handwriting builds stronger neural structures in memory than typing.) You might also photograph the card if you want to load it into a study app on your smartphone. Quiz yourself randomly on different types of problems. Another way to do this is to randomly flip through your book, pick out a problem, and see whether you can solve it cold.
6. **Take breaks.** It is common to be unable to solve problems or figure out concepts in math or science the first time you encounter them. This is why a little study every day is much better than a lot of studying all at once. When you get frustrated with a math or science problem, take a break so that another part of your mind can take over and work in the background.
7. **Use explanatory questioning and simple analogies.** Whenever you are struggling with a concept, think to yourself, How can I explain this so that a ten-year-old could understand it? Using an analogy really helps, like saying that the flow of electricity is like the flow of water. Don’t just think your explanation—say it out loud or put it in writing. The additional effort of speaking and writing allows you to more deeply encode (that is, convert into neural memory structures) what you are learning.
8. **Focus.** Turn off all interrupting beeps and alarms on your phone and computer, and then turn on a timer for twenty-five minutes. Focus intently for those twenty-five minutes and try to work as diligently as you can. After the timer goes off, give yourself a small, fun reward. A few of these sessions in a day can really move your studies forward. Try to set up times and places where studying—not glancing at your computer or phone—is just something you naturally do.
9. **Eat your frogs first.** Do the hardest thing earliest in the day, when you are fresh.
10. **Make a mental contrast.** Imagine where you’ve come from and contrast that with the dream of where your studies will take you. Post a picture or words in your workspace to remind you of your dream. Look at that when you find your motivation lagging. This work will pay off both for you and those you love!

# 10 Rules for Bad Studying
* A Mind for Numbers: How to Excel in Math and Science (Even if You Flunked Algebra), by Barbara Oakley, Penguin, July, 2014

1. **Passive rereading—**sitting passively and running your eyes back over a page. Unless you can prove that the material is moving into your brain by recalling the main ideas without looking at the page, rereading is a waste of time.
2. **Letting highlights overwhelm you.** Highlighting your text can fool your mind into thinking you are putting something in your brain, when all you’re really doing is moving your hand. A little highlighting here and there is okay—sometimes it can be helpful in flagging important points. But if you are using highlighting as a memory tool, make sure that what you mark is also going into your brain.
3. **Merely glancing at a problem’s solution and thinking you know how to do it.** This is one of the worst errors students make while studying. You need to be able to solve a problem step-by-step, without looking at the solution.
4. **Waiting until the last minute to study.** Would you cram at the last minute if you were practicing for a track meet? Your brain is like a muscle—it can handle only a limited amount of exercise on one subject at a time.
5. **Repeatedly solving problems of the same type that you already know how to solve.** If you just sit around solving similar problems during your practice, you’re not actually preparing for a test—it’s like preparing for a big basketball game by just practicing your dribbling.
6. **Letting study sessions with friends turn into chat sessions.** Checking your problem solving with friends, and quizzing one another on what you know, can make learning more enjoyable, expose flaws in your thinking, and deepen your learning. But if your joint study sessions turn to fun before the work is done, you’re wasting your time and should find another study group.
7. **Neglecting to read the textbook before you start working problems.** Would you dive into a pool before you knew how to swim? The textbook is your swimming instructor—it guides you toward the answers. You will flounder and waste your time if you don’t bother to read it. Before you begin to read, however, take a quick glance over the chapter or section to get a sense of what it’s about.
8. **Not checking with your instructors or classmates to clear up points of confusion.** Professors are used to lost students coming in for guidance—it’s our job to help you. The students we worry about are the ones who don’t come in. Don’t be one of those students.
9. **Thinking you can learn deeply when you are being constantly distracted.** Every tiny pull toward an instant message or conversation means you have less brain power to devote to learning. Every tug of interrupted attention pulls out tiny neural roots before they can grow.
10. **Not getting enough sleep.** Your brain pieces together problem-solving techniques when you sleep, and it also practices and repeats whatever you put in mind before you go to sleep. Prolonged fatigue allows toxins to build up in the brain that disrupt the neural connections you need to think quickly and well. If you don’t get a good sleep before a test, NOTHING ELSE YOU HAVE DONE WILL MATTER.
